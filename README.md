# TestForum
This educational project focuses on creating a simulated internet forum similar to Stack Overflow. It's designed to improve programming skills and familiarity with tools like GitHub and Docker. The project involves building a Web API using C# and the Entity Framework for data management. The goal is to distribute project responsibilities across various components to showcase modular software architecture. Version control using GitHub and containerization with Docker will be employed for efficient collaboration and deployment. Through hands-on experience, participants will enhance programming capabilities and gain insights into essential software development tools.
